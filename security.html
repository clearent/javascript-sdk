        <h3>Security Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your website must use HTTPS.</li>
            <li>Your website must not be framed in a website/domain that is not configured for your public key.</li>
            <li>Do not publish your public Key outside of your code.</li>
            <li>JavaScript SDK will only work on the website(s)/domain(s) you registered when onboarding to a JavaScript
                SDK account.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Browser Support</h3>

        Clearent’s JavaScript-SDK solution will work with
        <ul>
            <li>Chrome</li>
            <li>Firefox</li>
            <li>Edge</li>
            <li>Safari</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ending Support For IE 11 Browser and Legacy Edge</h3>

        <p>
            On August 17, 2020 <a target="_blank" href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-apps-say-farewell-to-internet-explorer-11-and/ba-p/1591666">
            Microsoft announced that they would be ending support for IE 11 or legacy Edge in Microsoft Teams and M365</a>. We believe that focusing on modern browsers that
            provide a faster, more secure, more robust browsing experience is the right decision.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beginning <b>July 1st, 2021</b>, we will no longer be providing coding shims (polyfills) for missing functionality in IE 11 or legacy Edge. <i>Please note, legacy Edge refers to the
            older pre-Chromium Edge browser released prior to January 2020. Modern Edge browser is supported.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            We understand that some merchants may wish to support IE 11 or legacy Edge for their websites (or applications that embed a Web Browser control based on an older browser)
            that use the Clearent JavaScript SDK. Our recommendation is to use <a target="_blank" href="https://polyfill.io/v3/">Polyfill.io</a>. The script tag below,
            when added to your page, will polyfill newer JavaScript functionality that is missing in IE 11 and legacy Edge. <i><b>Failure to add this script (or your own polyfill
            if desired) by July 1st, 2021 may render the Clearent JavaScript SDK inoperable on IE 11 or legacy Edge.</b></i>
        </p>

        <h3>Card Validation</h3>

        <p>In accordance with best security practices, all client data is validated on Clearent servers. We do perform
            basic client-side validation to improve the user-experience and reduce errors.
        </p>

        <p>Credit card numbers are validated on the client as follows:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Get card token or card field value (remove any non-numeric characters)</li>
            <li> Remaining digits must pass Luhn algorithm. This does not guarantee that the card is valid, simply that
                the card could be a valid card. This is done to help prevent typing errors.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The card number is not validated during this process
            and the user may
            have still entered a cancelled, non-issued or otherwise invalid card. The payment information is not
            validated on the backend
            until the sale request is made from your backend.
        </p>

        <p>This behavior is intentional and is done to prevent a hacker from attempting to use your website as a
            validator for stolen
            credit cards.
        </p>

        <h3>Expiration Date Validation</h3>

        <p>Expiration date is required for all transactions unless the merchant is storing and presenting card tokens to
            the user</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Get expiration date field (remove any non-numeric characters)</li>
            <li> Entered value must be four digits, 2-digit month and 2-digit year (MMYY)</li>
            <li> Entered year must be > current year OR (entered year must be >= current year AND entered month must be
                >= current month)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CSC/CVC Validation</h3>

        By default, the card security code (CSC, CID, CVC, CVV, CVV2) is required for all transactions.
        <ul>
            <li> Get CSC/CVC field (remove any non-numeric characters)</li>
            <li> If card is Visa, MasterCard, Discover, Diner’s Club or JCB then the security code must be 3 digits</li>
            <li> If card is American Express then security code must be 4 digits</li>
        </ul>
